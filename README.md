## Image File Creation Notes

### DDS Format Requirements
All image files should be saved in DDS format with the following specifications:
- Format: DXT5/BC3 compression
- MipMaps: Generate MipMaps
- Alpha channel: Required
- For best results, create original art at 2x resolution and scale down

### Tips for Image Creation
1. You can base your images on existing Victoria 3 icons for style consistency
2. For building icons, use isometric perspective similar to existing buildings
3. For production method icons, use simple recognizable symbols:
   - Traditional Gaming: Dice and tokens
   - Parlor Gaming: Card deck with elegant design
   - Wargaming: Miniature soldier with battlefield map
   - Gambling: Roulette wheel or poker chips
   - Chess variants: Various chess piece designs
   - Regional games: Distinctive play pieces for each game

4. For technology icons, include both the gaming element and something that represents the era (like technology or education)

### Stock Image Sources
If you don't wish to create custom icons, you can adapt from:
1. Existing Victoria 3 icons with modifications
2. Historical illustrations of games and gaming (public domain)
3. Vector icon collections (ensure appropriate licensing)
