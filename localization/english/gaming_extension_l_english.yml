  # New Events - Interest Group Reactions
  gaming_industry_event.20.t: "Religious Opposition to Gaming"
  gaming_industry_event.20.d: "Our expansion of gaming establishments, particularly those offering gambling, has drawn harsh criticism from religious leaders. They argue that games of chance corrupt moral character and lead to financial ruin for families. Sermons condemning gambling and gaming have become increasingly common, and pamphlets warning of moral decay are being distributed throughout our cities."
  gaming_industry_event.20.f: "The dice and cards are but the devil's playthings."
  gaming_industry_event.20.a: "Implement religious oversight of gaming establishments"
  gaming_industry_event.20.b: "These are merely entertainments, not moral concerns"

  # Regional Gaming Events
  gaming_industry_event.21.t: "Xiangqi: Chinese Chess"
  gaming_industry_event.21.d: "As our interest in strategic board games grows, we've encountered the Chinese game of Xiangqi, often called Chinese Chess. While sharing some similarities with Western chess, Xiangqi has distinctive differences: pieces are placed on the intersections rather than within squares, the board features a 'river' dividing the two sides, and unique pieces like the Cannon have no Western equivalent. Hosting a Xiangqi tournament could celebrate this tradition and potentially build cultural bridges."
  gaming_industry_event.21.f: "The General must be protected, for when he falls, the kingdom falls with him."
  gaming_industry_event.21.a: "Host a Xiangqi tournament"
  gaming_industry_event.21.b: "Focus on Western chess instead"

  # Colonial Gaming Events
  gaming_industry_event.22.t: "Indigenous Gaming Traditions"
  gaming_industry_event.22.d: "Our colonial officials have documented unique indigenous gaming traditions in our overseas territories. These games, deeply woven into local cultures, often reflect spiritual beliefs, social hierarchies, and environmental adaptations. Some colonial administrators suggest these games could be commercially exploited, while others argue for cultural exchange or suppression in favor of European games."
  gaming_industry_event.22.f: "The stones and seeds they play with hold centuries of tradition unknown to European parlors."
  gaming_industry_event.22.a: "Appropriate these games for commercial benefit"
  gaming_industry_event.22.b: "Establish a respectful cultural exchange"
  gaming_industry_event.22.c: "Suppress indigenous games in favor of European ones"

  # Educational Gaming Events
  gaming_industry_event.23.t: "Strategic Education Initiative"
  gaming_industry_event.23.d: "Educational reformers are proposing the integration of strategic games into our school curriculum. Chess, in particular, is highlighted for its ability to develop critical thinking, foresight, and pattern recognition. Some military officers have also noted the value of such games for developing tacticians, while economists point to the benefits for commercial strategy and negotiation skills."
  gaming_industry_event.23.f: "The chessboard is a battlefield of the mind."
  gaming_industry_event.23.a: "Implement a comprehensive gaming curriculum"
  gaming_industry_event.23.b: "Focus on military applications"

  # Trade Route Events
  gaming_industry_event.24.t: "Exotic Gaming Materials"

  gaming_industry_event.24.b: "Focus on domestic craftsmanship with local materials"

  # Diplomatic Tournament Events

Such an event could serve as a diplomatic platform while showcasing our cultural achievements. We must decide whether to make this a truly inclusive international event, focus on strengthening existing alliances, or perhaps use it as an opportunity for careful diplomacy with rivals."
  gaming_industry_event.25.f: "The battlefield of sixty-four squares can build bridges where traditional diplomacy fails."
  gaming_industry_event.25.a: "Host an inclusive international tournament"
  gaming_industry_event.25.b: "Invite our allies and exclude rivals"
  gaming_industry_event.25.c: "Focus on a diplomatic tournament with our rival"

  gaming_industry_event.26.t: "East-West Gaming Summit"
  gaming_industry_event.26.d: "Our deepening relations with East Asian nations have created an opportunity for a unique cultural exchange centered around strategic board games. While Western chess emphasizes piece capture and decisive battle, Eastern games like Go focus on territory control and long-term positioning. A summit bringing together masters of both traditions could strengthen diplomatic ties while enriching both gaming cultures."
  gaming_industry_event.26.f: "Two ancient traditions of strategic thought, meeting across a table."
  gaming_industry_event.26.a: "Host a cultural exchange focused on mutual understanding"

  gaming_industry_event.27.b: "Let them develop their career independently"

  gaming_industry_event.28.t: "Foreign Recruitment of Our Champion"
  gaming_industry_event.28.d: "Our chess champion has received a lucrative offer from a foreign power, including significant financial incentives, access to their elite training facilities, and the chance to compete regularly against their best players. This would represent a significant brain drain and loss of prestige for our nation, but attempting to match these terms would be expensive."
  gaming_industry_event.28.f: "The knight contemplates jumping to a more favorable position."
  gaming_industry_event.28.a: "Match their offer to keep our champion at home"
  gaming_industry_event.28.b: "We cannot justify such expense for games"

  # Underground Gaming Events
  gaming_industry_event.29.t: "Underground Gambling Den Discovered"
  gaming_industry_event.29.d: "Authorities have uncovered a sophisticated underground gambling operation operating in defiance of laws or social norms. Hidden in the basement of an innocuous building, this establishment has apparently been serving affluent citizens for months, offering games of chance and significant wagers. The discovery presents a choice: enforce prohibition vigorously, turn a blind eye for the right price, or reconsider our restrictive policies."
  gaming_industry_event.29.f: "Behind unmarked doors, fortunes change hands in smoky rooms."
  gaming_industry_event.29.a: "Raid and shut down this criminal enterprise"

  gaming_industry_event.30.t: "Secret Chess Society"
  gaming_industry_event.30.d: "A clandestine society has formed among our educated elite, devoted to studying Western chess as introduced by foreign diplomats. These intellectuals meet secretly to play and discuss this 'modern' game, seeing it as a symbol of progressive Western thought. While seemingly harmless, this represents a broader pattern of foreign cultural influence challenging traditional values and authority."
  gaming_industry_event.30.f: "The movement of wooden pieces across checkered boards signals shifting intellectual winds."
  gaming_industry_event.30.a: "Support this modernist cultural exchange"
  gaming_industry_event.30.b: "Ban this foreign influence and preserve our traditions"

  # Regressive Gaming Events
  gaming_industry_event.31.t: "Militaristic Gaming Ideology"
  gaming_industry_event.31.d: "Viktor Roth, a charismatic game designer with ultranationalist leanings, has developed a series of wargames that go beyond traditional military simulation. His games deliberately incorporate racial hierarchy theories, glorify conquest, and promote an extreme vision of national destiny. While his designs have technical merit, they clearly serve as vectors for radical nationalist ideology. Military officers have shown particular interest in Roth's work."
  gaming_industry_event.31.f: "The pieces on his board are not merely armies, but races locked in an eternal struggle for dominance."
  gaming_industry_event.31.a: "His games will strengthen our military spirit"
  gaming_industry_event.31.b: "Keep gaming apolitical and focused on education"
  gaming_industry_event.31.c: "Make his vision central to our national ideology"

  gaming_industry_event.32.t: "The Mystical Gaming Society"
  gaming_industry_event.32.d: "Edmund Blackwood, an aristocratic game designer, has founded an exclusive gaming society that incorporates occult themes and mystical symbolism into elaborate role-playing scenarios. His games combine traditional folklore with reactionary political themes, romanticizing feudal hierarchies and ancient bloodlines. While appealing to certain elite circles, these games promote a worldview that rejects modern social progress in favor of mystical traditionalism."
  gaming_industry_event.32.f: "Ancient runes and modern politics intertwine as players assume roles in a mythic hierarchy."
  gaming_industry_event.32.a: "Tolerate this as harmless eccentricity"
  gaming_industry_event.32.b: "Support these traditional cultural expressions"
  gaming_industry_event.32.c: "Condemn these occult activities"

  gaming_industry_event.33.t: "Racial Hierarchy in Games"
  gaming_industry_event.33.d: "Game designers in our nation have begun incorporating our social hierarchy directly into gaming materials. New games feature explicit racial categories with different abilities and values, reinforcing concepts of inherent superiority and inferiority. While some embrace these games as reflecting natural order, others argue that games should remain abstract to focus on strategy rather than politics."
  gaming_industry_event.33.f: "The ivory piece commands while the darker pieces serve - a board mirroring society."
  gaming_industry_event.33.a: "These games reinforce our social order"
  gaming_industry_event.33.b: "Focus on abstract strategy games like chess instead"
  gaming_industry_event.33.c: "Surprisingly, promote games with egalitarian themes"
